# Facial-Recognition
The AI-Enhanced Facial Recognition System for Real-Time Access Control is 
designed to provide a secure, efficient, and intelligent authentication mechanism using 
advanced AI techniques. This system leverages facial recognition technology to grant or 
restrict access based on real-time identity verification, ensuring a seamless and 
contactless security solution.By analyzing facial features and expressions, the system 
enhances accuracy in identifying individuals while also integrating emotion recognition 
to detect stress, confidence, or discomfort. This feature ensures not only security but also 
an adaptive and user-friendly experience.The platform is designed to improve 
accessibility and inclusivity, particularly for individuals with disabilities, by providing a 
hassle-free authentication method that does not rely on manual input or traditional 
biometric systems. Additionally, it incorporates a structured learning module that helps 
administrators and users understand system responses, ensuring a smooth interaction 
process.By combining AI-driven facial recognition, real-time analysis, and adaptive 
security mechanisms, this project aims to create a reliable and inclusive access control 
system that enhances both security and user experience.
